This internship has marked my initial foray into the realm of financial market, and the journey thus far has been incredibly rewarding. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to the Quantitative Research Department at SG CIB for affording me this valuable opportunity. I am sincerely thankful to the FIC/EXO team for welcoming me into their team during my internship.

My appreciation extends to my mentors, Mohammed and Sanaa, for their consistent encouragement and unwavering support throughout these months. Mohammed's guidance and assistance have been invaluable, providing me with advice and solutions whenever I encountered obstacles. Sanaa's incisive comment has been instrumental in pinpointing key issues. I have learned a great deal from both of them, and their insights have gradually revealed the allure of the quantitative field before me.

I am also grateful for the care and concern shown by my mentors, particularly on my first day when Sanaa accompanied me to the metro station. I extend my thanks to all my colleagues in the team. Despite my limited proficiency in expressing my thoughts in French, their kindness has made my experience immensely enjoyable.

In conclusion, I express my deep gratitude to everyone who has played a part in making this internship a transformative experience for me. This opportunity has enriched my understanding and ignited a growing fascination with the world of quantitative finance. Thank you!
