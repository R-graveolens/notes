In this report, we present an algorithm, building upon the foundation established in \cite{mission}, that offers a simultaneous generation of upper and lower bounds for American option prices. Additionally, we propose a refinement to the algorithm, primarily involving the substitution of the Milstein Scheme in place of the original Euler Scheme. After validating the algorithm through the examination of elementary example outlined in \cite{mission}, we extend its application to interest rate products under the Hull-White model. We comprehensively compare its performance against traditional PDE pricing methodologies and the Rogers' method. Ultimately, we introduced additional generalization by adding randomness to the market parameters, resulting in a more general model.
The transition to the Milstein Scheme showcases a commitment to precision, while the empirical evaluation within the Hull-White model, coupled with comparative assessments, substantiates the algorithm's efficacy. By culminating in a more generalized model through parameter randomization, this study underscores the algorithm's potential in a broader spectrum of scenarios.
